Define a naive generator that answers questions without retrieval (to simulate hallucination).\n","4. Define a RAG-style generator that first retrieves relevant passages and then uses them as context.\n","5. Compare answers with and without retrieval for a few example questions.\n","\n","To keep the notebook self-contained, we do not call any external LLM APIs.
